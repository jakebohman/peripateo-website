        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p><strong>Peripateo:</strong> to walk, progress, make way.</p>
        <p>Peripateo was founded in 2013 as a nondenominational journal of Christian discourse at Swarthmore College, associated with the <a href="https://www.veritas.org/augustine-collective">Augustine Collective</a>. We print once per semester, and we publish other pieces on our blog. Our mission is to explore the intersections of reason, science, academics, politics, and college life with the Christian experience. We publish anything from articles to photos, essays, reviews, and even poetry and art.</p>
        <p>Peripateo seeks to reconcile faith and academia by engaging religious issues through an intellectual lens. We believe that the message of Jesus Christ has powerful implications for our daily lives and the world at large. We come from a variety of Christian traditions and seek to represent a diversity of perspectives. Our goal is to fuse creativity and intellectualism in this journal to invite readers into a thoughtful discourse: what role does God play in our lives? What are the ways that a Christian perspective both complements and complicates an academic one?</p>
